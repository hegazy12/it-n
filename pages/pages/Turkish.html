                  of the Hagia Sophia Mosque (Aya Sofya) is not only one of the top things to do in Istanbul, but also in Turkey.

                  Built by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian in 537 CE, it is renowned as the Byzantine 
                  Empire's greatest architectural achievement and has remained the world's largest church for 1,000 years.
                  
                  The staggering bulk of its exterior is rimmed by the delicate minarets added after 
                  the Ottoman conquest, while the sumptuous and cavernous frescoed interior is a grand 
                  reminder of old Constantinople's might and power
                  This famed monument is a must-do for every tourist visiting the country.

                        <div class="noda"> <p>  Not to be missed, the mighty ruin of Ephesus is a city of colossal monuments and marble-columned roads.

                        One of the most complete, still-standing famed cities of antiquity in the Mediterranean region,
                         this is the place to experience what life must have been like during the golden age of the Roman Empire.
                        
                        The city's history dates back to the 10th century BCE, but the major monuments you see today all date
                         from its Roman era when it was a thriving commercial center.
                        
                        In particular, the Library of Celsus, the complex of frescoed terraced houses, and the Great Theater all point
                         to the wealth and importance of Ephesus during the Roman period.
                        
                        A sightseeing trip here will take at least half a day to cover 
                        the major highlights and longer, if you really want to explore, so make sure you 
                        plan your visit so you don't feel rushed

                              The surreal, swooping rock valleys of Cappadocia are every photographer's dream.
                              Cliff ridges and hill crests are home to rippling panoramas of wave-like rock or wacky-shaped pinnacles 
                              that have been formed by millennia of wind and water action.
                              
                              And if you don't feel like hiking for the views, this is one of the world's top destinations 
                              to take a hot-air balloon ride.
                              
                              Nestled in this unique lunar-like landscape are the frescoed rock-cut churches and cave-cut 
                              architecture of the Byzantine Era, when this area was home to monastic Christian communities.
                              In particular, the multiple cave-churches of Göreme Open-Air Museum and Ihlara Valley are home to some of
                               the best examples of surviving mid-Byzantine-era religious art in the world.
                              
                              Cappadocia's villages, half hewn into the hillsides, where travelers base themselves
                               to explore the surrounding countryside, are also an attraction in themselves, with their boutique hotels
                                that allow you to bed down in a cave with full contemporary comforts.

                           The sheltered inlet of Ölüdeniz, just a short journey from Fethiye, is Turkey's most famous beach, and with 
                            scenery that might as well have fallen off a perfect postcard, it's easy to see why its popularity hasn't
                            waned.
                            If the beach gets too crowded, it's time to take to the skies and experience the stunning aerial views on 
                               a tandem paragliding dive off the summit of mighty Babadağ (Mount Baba), which rises up behind the shore.

                                           While the old town area, snug right in the center of town, with its cobblestone alleyways rimmed

                                           The Antalya Museum is renowned as one of the country's best, with an astonishing collection of Hellenistic and Roman marble statuary, and there are bags of attractions outside of town
                                           for travelers who want to use Antalya as a base.  
                                          In particular, Antalya is an easy base for day trips to some of Turkey's most famous Greco-Roman ruins, including Aspendos and Perge,
                                           which are just outside the city, and the town of Side, with its glut of ruins.
